# nilearn-stats-tutorial
Beginner Nilearn tutorial for statistical analyses.

## Getting started
You can either run this tutorial on your own computer locally or online through binder.

### Run locally
To run this tutorial on your own computer, clone (or download) this repository. Then, assuming you have pip installed, run the following line in a terminal (in the root of this repository):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can start the notebook by running:

```
jupyter notebook nilearn_stats.ipynb
```

### Run with binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lukassnoek/nilearn-stats-tutorial/master)

*Note*: it appears that Binder crashes when trying to fit the first-level model, presumably because it runs out of RAM. I'm currently looking for a solution.
